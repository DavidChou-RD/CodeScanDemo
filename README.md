- What is Codeql

  CodeQL is the analysis engine used by developers to automate security checks, and by security researchers to perform variant analysis.

  >  In CodeQL, code is treated like data. Security vulnerabilities, bugs, and other errors are modeled as queries that can be executed against databases extracted from code. You can run the standard CodeQL queries, written by GitHub researchers and community contributors, or write your own to use in custom analyses. Queries that find potential bugs highlight the result directly in the source file.

- What is SonarQube

  > SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality. Sonar does static code analysis, which provides a detailed report of bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities, code duplications.

  It supports 27+ major programming languages through built-in rulesets and can also be extended with various plugins.
